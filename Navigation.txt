### Notes on Navigation in Linux

#### Basic Navigation Commands

- **pwd**: Displays current directory (`pwd` output: `/home/cry0l1t3`).
- **ls**: Lists contents of the current directory.
  - Basic usage: `ls` (lists directories and files).
  - With options: `ls -l` (detailed list including permissions, owner, size, date, time, and name).

#### Understanding `ls -l` Output

1. **Type and Permissions**: e.g., `drwxr-xr-x`
2. **Number of Hard Links**: e.g., `2`
3. **Owner**: e.g., `cry0l1t3`
4. **Group Owner**: e.g., `htbacademy`
5. **Size**: e.g., `4096` (in bytes)
6. **Date and Time**: e.g., `Nov 13 17:37`
7. **Name**: e.g., `Desktop`

#### Hidden Files and Directories

- Use `ls -la` to list all files, including hidden ones (those starting with a dot, like `.bashrc`).

#### Listing Directory Contents Remotely

- Use `ls` with a path to list contents of a specific directory: `ls -l /var/`

#### Changing Directories (`cd`)

- Basic usage: `cd <directory>`
- Example: `cd /dev/shm` to navigate to `/dev/shm`.
- Use `cd -` to return to the last directory.

#### Auto-Complete Function

- Pressing `[TAB]` twice after typing a partial directory name auto-completes or suggests matching directories.

#### Navigating to Parent Directory

- Use `cd ..` to go to the parent directory.

#### Clearing the Terminal

- `clear` command or `[Ctrl] + [L]` shortcut.

#### Command History Navigation

- Use arrow keys (↑/↓) to scroll through command history.
- Use `[Ctrl] + [R]` for reverse search in command history.
