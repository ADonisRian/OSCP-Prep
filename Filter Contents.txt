### Filtering Content in Linux

#### Overview
Linux offers a variety of command-line tools to filter and process file contents. These tools are essential for efficiently handling text files, especially large ones, and are crucial for system administration tasks.

#### Tools and Usage

1. **More and Less**
   - `more` and `less` are interactive pagers to view file content.
   - **More**: Displays content page-wise but leaves output in the terminal.
     ```bash
     more /etc/passwd
     ```
   - **Less**: Similar to `more` but does not leave output in the terminal.
     ```bash
     less /etc/passwd
     ```

2. **Head and Tail**
   - `head` displays the first ten lines of a file.
     ```bash
     head /etc/passwd
     ```
   - `tail` displays the last ten lines of a file.
     ```bash
     tail /etc/passwd
     ```

3. **Sort**
   - Sorts file content alphabetically or numerically.
     ```bash
     cat /etc/passwd | sort
     ```

4. **Grep**
   - Searches for patterns in the text.
   - Example: Find users with "/bin/bash" shell.
     ```bash
     cat /etc/passwd | grep "/bin/bash"
     ```
   - Exclude specific patterns using `-v`.
     ```bash
     cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin"
     ```

5. **Cut**
   - Removes specific delimiters and displays specified positions.
     ```bash
     cat /etc/passwd | cut -d":" -f1
     ```

6. **Tr**
   - Replaces certain characters.
     ```bash
     cat /etc/passwd | tr ":" " "
     ```

7. **Column**
   - Displays results in tabular form.
     ```bash
     cat /etc/passwd | tr ":" " " | column -t
     ```

8. **Awk**
   - Programming language for text processing.
   - Example: Display first and last field.
     ```bash
     cat /etc/passwd | awk '{print $1, $NF}'
     ```

9. **Sed**
   - Stream editor for text manipulation.
   - Example: Replace "bin" with "HTB".
     ```bash
     ... | sed 's/bin/HTB/g'
     ```

10. **Wc**
    - Counts lines, words, characters in text.
    - Example: Count lines.
      ```bash
      ... | wc -l
      ```

#### Practice Exercises
Using `/etc/passwd`, practice the following tasks:

1. **Find Specific User**
   ```bash
   grep "cry0l1t3" /etc/passwd
   ```

2. **Extract Usernames**
   ```bash
   cut -d":" -f1 /etc/passwd
   ```

3. **User and UID**
   ```bash
   grep "cry0l1t3" /etc/passwd | cut -d":" -f1,3
   ```

4. **User and UID with Comma**
   ```bash
   grep "cry0l1t3" /etc/passwd | cut -d":" -f1,3 --output-delimiter=','
   ```

5. **Username, UID, Shell with Comma**
   ```bash
   grep "cry0l1t3" /etc/passwd | cut -d":" -f1,3,7 --output-delimiter=','
   ```

6. **All Usernames, UID, Shells with Comma**
   ```bash
   cut -d":" -f1,3,7 --output-delimiter=',' /etc/passwd
   ```

7. **Exclude nologin/false Users**
   ```bash
   grep -v "nologin\|false" /etc/passwd | cut -d":" -f1,3,7 --output-delimiter=','
   ```

8. **Count Filtered Output**
   ```bash
   grep -v "nologin\|false" /etc/passwd | wc -l
   ```
