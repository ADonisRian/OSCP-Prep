### Regular Expressions (RegEx) Practice Exercises

#### Exercise Instructions
Using the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file, perform the following tasks with RegEx:

1. **Lines Without '#'**
   - Goal: Display lines that do not contain the character `#`.
   - Command: `grep -v "#" /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

2. **Lines with Words Starting with 'Permit'**
   - Goal: Find lines with words beginning with "Permit".
   - Command: `grep -E "\bPermit\w*" /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
   - Explanation: `\b` denotes a word boundary, and `\w*` matches any word character.

3. **Lines with Words Ending in 'Authentication'**
   - Goal: Locate lines with words ending in "Authentication".
   - Command: `grep -E "\w*Authentication\b" /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

4. **Lines Containing the Word 'Key'**
   - Goal: Find lines that contain the word "Key".
   - Command: `grep "Key" /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

5. **Lines Starting with 'Password' and Containing 'yes'**
   - Goal: Search for lines that start with "Password" and include "yes".
   - Command: `grep -E "^Password.*yes" /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
   - Explanation: `^` indicates the start of a line.

6. **Lines Ending with 'yes'**
   - Goal: Display lines that end with "yes".
   - Command: `grep -E "yes$" /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
   - Explanation: `$` signifies the end of a line.

#### Understanding Regular Expressions
- **Powerful Tool**: RegEx allows for complex pattern searching and manipulation in text.
- **Syntax and Operators**:
  - **Grouping**: `(a)` for specific group patterns.
  - **Character Classes**: `[a-z]` for a range of characters.
  - **Quantifiers**: `{1,10}` for specifying repetitions.
  - **OR Operator (`|`)**: Matches either of the expressions.
  - **AND Operator (`.*`)**: Matches both expressions in sequence.
- **Applications**: Widely used in grep, sed, and other tools for text processing.

#### Tips for Practicing RegEx
- **Experimentation**: Try modifying the expressions for different outcomes.
- **Manual Pages**: Use `man grep` for more grep-specific RegEx options.
- **Online Resources**: Utilize online RegEx testers for practice and validation.

RegEx is a versatile tool essential for efficient text processing and data analysis in various computing environments.
